# AI System Control App (Android + On-Device AI)

An AI-powered Android application that enables users to control device functions using natural voice and text commands. The system integrates NLP, on-device machine learning (TensorFlow Lite), and Android system APIs to execute commands intelligently and efficiently.

---

## Overview

This application transforms traditional mobile interaction by replacing manual navigation with intelligent command-based control. Users can perform system-level tasks such as opening apps, searching files, and monitoring device status using simple natural language inputs.

The app is designed with a hybrid AI architecture that combines rule-based logic with machine learning for better accuracy and performance.
